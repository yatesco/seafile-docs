# Enabling Https with Nginx

Here we use self-signed SSL certificate. If you use a paid ssl certificate from some authority, just skip the first step.

### Generate SSL certificate with OpenSSL
```bash
    openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048
    openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095
```

If you're using a custom CA to sign your SSL certificate, you have to enable certificate revocation list (CRL) in your certificate. Otherwise http syncing on Windows client may not work. See [this thread](https://forum.seafile-server.org/t/https-syncing-on-windows-machine-using-custom-ca/898) for more information.

### Enable SSL module of Nginx (optional)
If your Nginx does not support SSL, you need to recompile it, the commands are as follows:
```bash
    ./configure --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module
    make && make install
```

### Modify Nginx configuration file

Assume you have configured nginx as
[Deploy-Seafile-with-nginx](deploy_with_nginx.md). To use https, you need to modify your nginx configuration file.
```nginx
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  seafile.example.com;
        rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;	# force redirect http to https
    }

    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;    	# path to your cacert.pem
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# path to your privkey.pem
        server_name seafile.example.com;
        # ......
        fastcgi_param   HTTPS               on;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_SCHEME         https;
    }
```


### Sample configuration file

Here is the sample configuration file:

```nginx
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  seafile.example.com;
        rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;	# force redirect http to https
    }
    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;        # path to your cacert.pem
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# path to your privkey.pem
        server_name seafile.example.com;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
        server_tokens off;

        location / {
            fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:8000;
            fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME     $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO           $fastcgi_script_name;

            fastcgi_param   SERVER_PROTOCOL	    $server_protocol;
            fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING        $query_string;
            fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD      $request_method;
            fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE        $content_type;
            fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH      $content_length;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_ADDR         $server_addr;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_PORT         $server_port;
            fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME         $server_name;
            fastcgi_param   REMOTE_ADDR         $remote_addr;
            fastcgi_param   HTTPS               on;
            fastcgi_param   HTTP_SCHEME         https;

            access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
    	    error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
    	    fastcgi_read_timeout 36000;
        }
        location /seafhttp {
            rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;
            client_max_body_size 0;
            proxy_connect_timeout  36000s;
            proxy_read_timeout  36000s;
            proxy_send_timeout  36000s;
            send_timeout  36000s;
        }
        location /media {
            root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub;
        }
    }
```

### Large file uploads

Tip for uploading very large files (> 4GB): By default Nginx will buffer large request body in temp file. After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (seaf-server in our case). But it seems when file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle. So if you want to support file upload larger for 4GB, we suggest you install Nginx version >= 1.8.0 and add the following options to Nginx config file:

```nginx
    location /seafhttp {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }

```

If you have WebDAV enabled it is recommended to add the same:

```nginx
    location /seafdav {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }
```

### Reload Nginx
```bash
    nginx -s reload
```

## Modify settings to use https

### ccnet conf

Since you changed from http to https, you need to modify the value of `SERVICE_URL` in [ccnet.conf](../config/ccnet-conf.md). You can also modify `SERVICE_URL` via web UI in "System Admin->Settings". (**Warning**: If you set the value both via Web UI and ccnet.conf, the setting via Web UI will take precedence.)

```bash
SERVICE_URL = https://seafile.example.com
```

### seahub_settings.py

You need to add a line in seahub_settings.py to set the value of `FILE_SERVER_ROOT`. You can also modify `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` via web UI in "System Admin->Settings". (**Warning**: If you set the value both via Web UI and seahub_settings.py, the setting via Web UI will take precedence.)

```python
FILE_SERVER_ROOT = 'https://seafile.example.com/seafhttp'
```

## Start Seafile and Seahub

```bash
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start-fastcgi
```

## Additional modern settings for nginx (optional)

### Activate IPv6

Require IPv6 on server otherwise the server will not start! Also the AAAA dns record is required for IPv6 usage.

```nginx
listen 443;
listen [::]:443;
```

### Activate HTTP2

Activate HTTP2 for more performance. Only available for SSL and nginx version>=1.9.5. Simply add `http2`.
```nginx
listen 443 http2;
listen [::]:443 http2;
```

## Additional security settings for nginx (optional)

Add the HSTS header. If you already visited the https version the next time your browser will directly visit the https site and not the http one. Prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks:
```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
```

Disable exact server version in header. Prevent scans for vulnerable server.
```nginx
server_tokens off;
```
